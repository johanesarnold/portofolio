          I have 3+ years of experience as a software engineer. I have strong knowledge about Software Development Life Cycle with a Bachelor's degree focused in Computer Science from BINUS University with 3.66 of GPA. My expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and async mechanisms).

          I have strong desire to put together well-written code that helps to create advanced applications which are fit for purpose, functionally correct and meets the user's precise needs. Right now I would like to join company where there is a culture of encouragement, respect and teamwork.
